# Simulating Techniques with Missing Data

## Description
Missing data is a common issue in many datasets. If not handled properly, missing data can result in biased estimations and/or loss of power. I explore the different missingness mechanisms and several different techniques to deal with missing data including ad hoc methods, multiple imputation, and maximum likelihood. I use a simulation approach to uncover how each of these techniques compare to analysis with a complete dataset as well as their limitations. 

## Background

### Missing Data Patterns
There are many missing data patterns.  Below illustrates a few patterns that may appear in a dataset.
